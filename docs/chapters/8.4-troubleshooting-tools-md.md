### Debugging with Tracking Monitors

Tracking monitors can be displayed to identify errors and help answer questions related to device availability, poor location data errors, how the tracking results are calculated, etc. The messages are displayed in blue to help identify and highlight them.

- Select *Event Log > Actions > Show/Hide Tracking Monitors* command.

### Debugging with Log Level

The *Log Level* on the *Event Log > Actions* drop down list and on the *Configurator > Other Parameters* screen specify the type of logging records to add to the Home Assistant log file (*home-assistant.log*). They are:

**Info** - Normal operations, add few records for the results of a location request.

**Debug** - Add more detailed records related to location requests, how the data is processed and the results.

**RawData** - Add records for setting up iCloud3 (device_tracker and sensor entities, zones, devices, etc.), the Mobile App data used to handle location update and triggers and the data requested from and received from iCloud Location Servers.
