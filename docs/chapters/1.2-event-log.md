## 1.2 Event Log  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The Event Log is a Lovelace custom card that shows past and current activity related to tracking a device. This includes:

- Startup configuration.
- Device information for Family Sharing, Find-my-Friends and iOS App devices and entities.
- Tracking results including zone, travel time and distance data.
- Error messages, problems and location data issues.
- Detail tracking monitors that show what is going on under the covers, how location data from the iCloud Location Services and the iOS App is analyzed and processed.

The Event Log has an *Actions* command menu that can control iCloud3 operations and the type of information to display in the Event Log or the Home Assistant log file. This includes:

- Restart iCloud3 without restarting Home Assistant
- Pause and resume tracking
- Relocate all devices
- Issue a *Find My Device* alert
- Export the Event Log to a text file
- Show/hide tracking monitors
- Start/stop detailed debugging that will dump set up information and all raw data received from iCloud Location Services.

Note: The Event Log is installed into the *config/www/icloud3* directory. This directory can be changed on the *Configure Settings > Tracking & Other Parameters* screen on Menu page #2.
