## Configuration Screen Issues  {docsify-ignore}


#### My iPhone/iPad is not in the *Update Device screen > Family Sharing Device* selection list

It is displayed on the *FindMy App Devices* screen but I can not select it when configuring the device.

This means that Location Sharing is probably not enabled on the iDevice. On the iDevice:
- Go to *Settings App > Privacy and Security > Location Services - Share My Location* screen. Verify that *Location Sharing* is enabled.
- Go to *FindMy App > Me* screen.  The *Location* field should be "Shared". If it is "â€˜Not Sharing Location", Location Sharing is still not enabled.
