### 1.2.3 Lovelace Resource for the Event Log

The Lovelace Resources points to the location of the *icloud3-event-log-card.js* file and must be set up for the Event Log to be displayed.  If a problem occurs setting up the Lovelace Resource automatically, the Event Log (on the right in the above screenshot) will not be displayed and the following will be displayed instead:

2. Select **+ Add Resource** to open the Add Resources window (on the left).

3. Enter the following:

   - **/local/icloud3/icloud3-event-log-card.js** in the **URL** field
   - Check **JavaScript Module**
4. Select **Create (or Update)**

> *Note: Using another custom card directory* - If you move the Event Log card to another directory, the Lovelace Resources should automatically be changed. If something happens and it is not changed, change the directory (*icloud3*) in the URL statement on the above screen to the new directory name. Then select the new directory name in the *Event Log Directory* field on the *iCloud3 Configure Settings > Menu Page 2 > Other Parameters*  screen.
