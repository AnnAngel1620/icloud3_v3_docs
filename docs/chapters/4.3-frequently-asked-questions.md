# Frequently Asked Questions

### Tracking problems:

#### Not all devices are tracked:

There are several causes of this problem. See Troubleshooting Problems for things to check.



#### The phone does not exit a zone:

If the device is using the iOS App, iCloud3 is not getting an exit zone trigger. See Troubleshooting Problems for things to check.



#### App Specific Passwords 
App Specific Passwords are not supported by iCloud3. iCloud3 is a program running on a computer, not an app running on an iDevice. It uses web service calls to request the location of the devices in the iCloud's Family Sharing List. Apps running on iDevices use a different access method that is not available by programs.
