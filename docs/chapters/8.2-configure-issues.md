## Configuration Screen Issues

------
<details>
<summary>My iPhone/iPad is not in the <i>Update Device screen > Family Sharing Device</i> selection list</summary>
<p>It is displayed on the <em>FindMy App Devices</em> screen but I can not select it when configuring the device.</p>
<p>This means that Location Sharing is probably not enabled on the iDevice. On the iDevice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <em>Settings App &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Location Services - Share My Location</em> screen. Verify that <em>Location Sharing</em> is enabled.</li>
<li>Go to <em>FindMy App &gt; Me</em> screen.  The <em>Location</em> field should be &quot;Shared&quot;. If it is &quot;â€˜Not Sharing Location&quot;, Location Sharing is still not enabled.</li>
</ul>
</details>
