The *Configure Settings* consists of 2 menus and 10+ parameter entry screens. Each screen has two parts:

- **Selection or parameter entry (top part)** - This is used to select a task to be done, an item to be selected or an option list/text field for the parameter being configured.
- **Command or Action to be done (bottom part)** - First select the desired option (Select/Next/Add/Update/Delete/etc.), then select the command in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen (Next/Submit/Finish/etc.).
